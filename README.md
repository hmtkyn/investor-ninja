# **"Investor Ninja"** Strategy in Crypto Investing

### Investor Ninja Strategy in Crypto Investing

##### How much profit can you make in the long run by investing in specific periods?

Here is the backward strategy that answers this question and it's called "Investor Ninja".

The important thing is to make regular purchases by keeping the amount in your hand constant every month or every 4 weeks.

This strategy has been tested on the Bitcoin / Dollar chart. You can test it on other instruments if you wish.

Now, from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022, I invested $100 in Bitcoin every Friday every 4 weeks.

You can observe the results yourself.

You will be amazed at the difference between just buying instead of constantly Buying and Sell and selling when it comes after a long time!

If you regularly invest in investment tools, you will see that you will really profit. Please consider every investment long term.

Best regards
