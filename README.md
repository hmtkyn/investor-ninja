# **"Investor Ninja"** Strategy in Crypto Investing

> How much profit can you make in the long run by investing in certain periods?

Here is the backward strategy that answers this question and it's called "Investor Ninja".

The important thing is to make regular purchases by keeping the amount in your hand constant at the closings of each month.

This strategy has been tested on the Bitcoin / Dollar chart.

Now, from January 1, 2020 to November 5, 2021, I have invested $1,000 in Bitcoin on the 1st of each month.

Then at the end of 23 months, my net profit from my $23,000 investment is $67,732.

If you thought that this strategy was only tested during the bull season of Cryptocurrencies, you are wrong. You can test the test rates for other time periods yourself. You will be surprised!

If you invest in investment instruments on a regular basis, you will see that you will really gain.
